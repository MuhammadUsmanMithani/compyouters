# Compyouters.ORG
## Hello There ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to Compyouters.ORGâ€”an open-source project made by a [team of high school students](https://compyouters.org/team). It has been a passion project of mine, the CEO (Muhammad Usman Mithani), for over a year. I have always been fascinated by computers and how they work. I have always wanted to learn more about them, but I found that most of the resources available online were either too technical from the get-go, or too boring. That's why I decided to create this projectâ€”to make learning about computers fun and easy for everyone, especially those who have not had such opportunities or resources to be able to learn about it themselves.

The best part is, this is an open-source project, which means anyone who has more knowledge about computer hardware and computer science can contribute to this project and make it better with simple markdown! You can find the source code of this project on [GitHub](https://compyouters.org/github).

One of my aims of this project was to make it as accessible as possible. That's why We have made sure that this project is mobile-friendly, lightweight, and can be accessed by anyone with just an internet connection. We have also made sure that the content is easy to understand and is not too technical. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to create an issue or pull request on [the Github repository](https://compyouters.org/github).

We will be trying to release one chapter every two weeks, so stay tuned for more.

## Contributing
To contribute, you will need to have git installed on your computer. You can install it by following [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). You will also need to be experienced with git to be able to contribute. Once you have git installed, you can follow these steps to contribute to the project:

1. Fork the repository by clicking on the 'Fork' button on the top right corner of the repository page.
2. Clone your fork of the repository to your local machine by running `git clone <LINK_TO_YOUR_FORK>.git`
3. Perform the changes you want to make on your local machine, stage, and commit them, and push them to your fork.
4. Create a pull request by clicking on the 'New Pull Request' button on the original repository page and select your fork, detailing the changes you have made.

> <note>If you want to create or modify chapters for this page, you can do that by just using markdown. In your cloned repository, add the chapter name you want, no matter if it has any special characters, to `/chapters/list.json` and then create a new file in the `/chapters/` directory with the same name as that added to the list, only with all characters lowercased, all special characters removed and all spaces turned to underscores (`_`). Push this and once merged, your chapter will automatically be loaded over on the website.</note>

If you like this project and would want us to expand it further, please [consider donating](https://compyouters.org/donate). It would help me a lot in being able to sustain the project for longer and investing in it to make it better!

We hope you enjoy reading this as much as we enjoyed making it!
