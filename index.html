            # Hello There üëã
            Welcome to Compyouters. An open-source project made by me, [Muhammad Usman Mithani](https://iammithani.is-a.dev/), a solo hobbyist programmer and web developer. I have long had an interest in tech and computer hardware but did not find any single resource that would teach me about it in an interesting way. That's where I decided to combine the knowledge I have received from researching through different sources and into one place that can easily be accessed by anyone.

            The best part is, this is an open-source project, which means anyone who has more knowledge about computer hardware and computer science can contribute to this project and make it better with simple markdown! You can find the source code of this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/MuhammadUsmanMithani/compyouters).

            One of my aims of this project was to make it as accessible as possible. That's why I have made sure that this project is mobile-friendly, lightweight, and can be accessed by anyone with just an internet connection. I have also made sure that the content is easy to understand and is not too technical. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to create an issue or pull request on [the Github repository](https://github.com/MuhammadUsmanMithani/compyouters).
            
            I will be trying to release one chapter every two weeks, so stay tuned for more.

            Inspirations for this project:
            - [CPU.land](https://cpu.land/)
            - [Techquickie](https://www.youtube.com/@techquickie)
            - [Sir Zain Merchant](https://www.instagram.com/cswithzain/)

            If you like this project and would want me to expand it further, please [consider donating](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/iammithani). It would help me a lot in being able to sustain the project for longer and investing in it to make it better!

            I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed making it.
